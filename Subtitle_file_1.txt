1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So you have completed your Fusion model

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and you want to export some of the faces out as SVGs.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
There is not an inbuilt way in Fusion to do this easily,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
but thankfully, we're able to download various plug-ins

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
from the Autodesk App Store, which enable us to do various things.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
One such thing is exporting faces as SVG files.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
To do this, we're going to have to go up to Google Chrome.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And when we're on Chrome, we're going to type in Autodesk App Store.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And clicking on the first link will take

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
us to the App Store, where we can then search through an app.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The app we're looking for is called Shaper Utilities.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
As you type it, it should auto-fill it out.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Then you can click on it and it will take you to the page.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Clicking on the plugin will then take you

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
to its homepage, where you can then go ahead and download the plugin yourself.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's important to make sure you choose the correct operating system,

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
whether you're on a Mac or whether you're on a PC.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Once you've switched over to the correct

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
one, I'm on a Windows device, so I chose Windows, you'll press Download.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If you aren't already logged in, it will ask you to log in and you'll have

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
to press the Download button again, I'm already logged into my Fusion account.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'll then click Download, and it will begin downloading

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
the installation file down here in the corner.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Once that's finished, we will open that file up,

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
install it, and then it should be available in Fusion after a quick restart.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Now that this is finished downloading,

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
we can click on it and it should begin the installation process.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If you get this Windows protecting your

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
PC, you can always press the More Info and press Run anyway.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Awesome.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Now we're going to need to restart our

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Fusion in our application so that our plugin will appear.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm going to quickly close that down.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Now let's reopen up our design.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The picnic table,

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
which is what we made in the last tutorial.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Now looking at our fusion model, there are going to be three things

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
that we're going to want to export as SVG files.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We're going to want to do this base of our table-top.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We're also then going to do our U-leg over

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
here, and then our third single leg by itself.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
In order to get to the plugin that we installed, we need to go up here

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
to utilities and you'll find over on the side here,

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
there will be a new section with a little shape called Export to Origin.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
This is the plugin that we just installed.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You can see by the same logo.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We will click on this and then we're going to make a selection.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Now it says here, Select a single face to define the top of the model.

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
All details that can be cut from the top

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
will be exported as an appropriately coloured, coded, SVG file.

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
If you select Advanced, you can choose a body or choose just a face or an entire

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
sketch if you wanted to export the sketch instead.

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
However, most of the time you won't need to use the advanced.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Instead, we'll just need to define the top or the top face of your model.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Let's start with our picnic table.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm going to select that.

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It will show here one selected and it will

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
be highlighted in blue, and then we'll press OK.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Next, it will ask you to save that SPG file to an appropriate location.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
For now, I'm just going to save this to my downloads folder.

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
We will call this, picnic table top.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And Save.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And we repeat that process for each of the other faces that we need to export.

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So again, click on the shape or origin,

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
choose the face, make sure it says selected, and press OK.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And then give it a name, U-Leg.

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Click New Table U-Leg.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Save.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
One more time, export origin, choose the face, select OK, and give it a name.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Picnic Table, Straight, Leg.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Now we've saved those three files to the SVG files.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Let's say that we wanted to laser cut out these three pieces.

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
In order to do that,

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
we would need to get the files set up in illustrator so we can have

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
the appropriate colors attached to each of the lines and the fill shapes.

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
For now, let's just close Fusion and

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
we will open up the illustrator and show you what the files look like as

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
they were exported from the Shaper Utilities and how we can correct

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
that in illustrator to be appropriate for your laser cover.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:09,000
All right, with illustrator open,

81
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm actually going to open up a template, which I've created to help me remind

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:24,000
myself of the different colors and the line thicknesses that I need.

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This template will be available in the description because it's very

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
helpful to have all the information that you need available.

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So when we are getting a file ready for the laser cutter,

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
we need to make sure each of the lines are set to the appropriate color,

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and we need to make sure the line width is set to 0.001.

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Raster means that it's going to be based on the shade of black that it's going

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
to be, will determine how much power the laser is going to have.

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So it enables you to laser cut or etch into your wood an actual image because it

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
will do some darker parts darker and some lighter parts lighter.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
If there's something that you need to have

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
that done, it needs to be in black and white.

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
If there's a line that we're going to be

95
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
the laser will be cutting around, we need to make sure that it's got full red.

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So that means that in an RGB file, the red is going to be at 255,

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
and then the blue and the green are both going to be at zero and zero.

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
If we're etching,

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
meaning we're not cutting all the way through the piece of wood or the material

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
that we're using, then we're going to want to make sure it's completely blue.

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That means that the red, the green and the blue,

102
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
the red and the green are going to be zero and the blue is going to be at 255.

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Let's get one of our files that we just

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
exported into here and we'll just drag this picnic table top into illustrator.

105
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Once in illustrator, we're going to want to change the lines

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
because currently we have a black fill with no outline.

107
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The first thing we need to do is actually change our colour mode from CMYK to RGB.

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Because remember

109
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
that in order for the laser cutter to interpret the colors correctly,

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
there needs to be an RGB mode and there needs to be a red if we're going to be

111
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
doing cutting, which is what we're going to be doing.

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
In our file to change the document type

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
to RGB, we're going to go to File, down to Document Colour mode.

114
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm going to choose RGB colour.

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Sometimes this may not always work and you

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
may actually have your colour palette not showing any colours.

117
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But if you go into it and just sure you

118
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
select RGB again, it should make sure that it auto-corrects

119
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
so that you're able to get lots of different colors.

120
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Once you've got your RGB mode set,

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
change from CMYK to RGB, we're then going to want to go up to here

122
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
to our stroke and change our stroke to the values that we talked about before.

123
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So our red is going to be want to be 255,

124
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
with our green and our blue both being at zero.

125
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Next, we want to change our stroke width.

126
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Our stroke width and line width needs

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
to be at 0.001. So over here on the stroke,

128
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
we will just click in this box and change this to 0.001 and hit Enter.

129
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Lastly, we need to remove the fill because

130
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
any black that is on our file, it will raster it.

131
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It will do a back and forth like printing

132
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
from an inkjet printer and will be completely burnt out across the top.

133
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We're going to click on the black and we're going to remove the fill.

134
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So now it's gone completely.

135
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And if I select out of here,

136
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
you should be able to see a faint red line where it's going to cut.

137
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Secondly, I can see that there are two

138
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
other lines here which are currently black.

139
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I don't want those to be rastered.

140
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I want them to be cut out because they are handles.

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm going to select that object, go to my Fill, remove the Fill,

142
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:55,000
change my stroke to red 255, green 0 and blue 0.

143
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Then change my stroke width to 0.001, hit Enter.

144
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm going to do this for each object that I want to cut out.

145
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:15,000
No fill, red all the way up to 255, stroke width 0.001, Enter.

146
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
This is what your file should look like

147
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
when you want to send it up to the laser cutter.

148
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm going to do this for each individual piece that we have.

149
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Once you've done this process to all parts

150
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
of the depicting table, you're going to want to copy and paste

151
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
each of the individual parts into the template provided.

152
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
There are a couple of reasons we want to do this.

153
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
One of the reasons is that the template is set to the size of the laser cutter.

154
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The template I've got open here is set

155
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
to a bigger laser cutter, which is 810 by 450 millimetres.

156
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And if you look in the description,

157
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
there is a template for the smaller one, which is 600 by 450.

158
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The other reason that we want to put our individual pieces into this template is

159
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
because this template is set to millimetres.

160
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
If we looked in our picnic table top SVG file and tried to look at the size

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
of an object, we would see that it is set to point values.

162
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And we actually want this to be set

163
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
to millimeter values before we send it to the laser cutter.

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So on our template folder, it's actually already set up to be in millimeters.

165
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So to copy something from one file to another, we're going to select

166
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
everything in the file by pressing File, pressing CTRL A or Command A if you're

167
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
on a Mac, then pressing CTRL C or Command C to copy.

168
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Then moving over to our template file and pressing CTRL V or Command V to paste.

169
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And this will paste in our file that we had taken from the other one.

170
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Now I can see that my tabletop is currently rotated the wrong direction.

171
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
In order to rotate this around, I'm going to take my mouse over to one

172
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
of the corners until it goes into a little 90 degree angle with two arrows on it.

173
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I can click and drag to then rotate this piece around 90 degrees.

174
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
When you're rotating,

175
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
if you hold down the Shift key, you'll be able to snap it in 45 degree increments.

176
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Then just move it down to the white portion of the template and you can see

177
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
how much space your table is going to take up on the laser cutter.

178
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Now that I have my picnic table top within

179
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
the template, I can see that I'm probably only going to want to have this as its own

180
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
laser cut file because it takes up so much of the space of the laser cutter.

181
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I will probably do the U-leg and the straight leg on a separate file.

182
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Before I save this file, I want to make sure that it's going to be

183
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
the right size to fit the piece of material that I'm going to have,

184
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
or make sure I cut the material that goes into the laser cutter to the right size.

185
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
To do this while selecting the biggest

186
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
object within your space, you can go up here to the transform tool and select it.

187
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Over here under width and height, it will tell you in millimeters the width

188
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
of the object and the height of the object.

189
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
The reason it shows you the width and height in millimeters within this

190
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
template is because it's set that the unit of measurement is set as millimeters.

191
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
If you tried to do this within the other

192
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
individual files that Fusion made for us, you would see that it is set as point,

193
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
which is good when you're working on objects.

194
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But before you send the object to a laser

195
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
cutter or another device that's going to be using millimeters as the unit

196
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
of measurement, it's always a good idea to check it to make sure

197
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
that the millimeter size is the correct size that you need.

198
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So this file is ready for me to save and send to the laser cutter.

199
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And that's it. That's how we export

200
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
some faces from our Fusion model using the Shaper Utility to then get them

201
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
into Illustrator, set up the colours correctly,

202
00:12:44,000 --> 00:15:00,000
place them into a template and save them ready to send to the laser cutter.

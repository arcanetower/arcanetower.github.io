Its elegance is matched by the backdrop of lush forests which have helped shape the city to what it is today. The climate these forests brought was of great importance, but they were also influential when it came to architectural designs as the vast majority of buildings have been built with many natural elements to keep in line with the forests. The skyline is packed with soaring skyscrapers and their history seemed to shine more now than ever. Trade is at an all-time high in Watford and it has attracted a lot of attention. Many new cultures have left their mark not just on trade and relations, but also upon the citys identity. What historically was a city of predictability has grown into a fusion of everything and it is this that unites the people to this day. It is this multicultural identity that has truly left its mark. Hundreds of Diners, Taverns, Tea Shops, and Inns offer a plethora of culinary choices for those who feel hungry. There is something for everyone to enjoy nature, libraries, or one of the many recreational venues.<p><br><a href="watford.html">Town Map</a>', {
